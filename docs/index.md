# Clawr: Coding with Roaring Clarity

![Rawr|150](./images/rawr.png)

It started as the “Azeea Language,” or Azlan for short. Aslan, of course, is “the Lion” in the title of C.S. Lewis’ famous book *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. The name was at the same time not very unique, and too tied to the company name. I tried discarding the lion concept entirely, instead going with Oolang (mild tea) for a while. But that name was too cute, and the lion kept roaring in the background. So I decided to bring it back.

The name Clawr is a portmanteau of the word “clarity” and a lion’s “rawr.” The alternative spelling was chosen in part because the resulting name spells out the word “claw,” another stereotypical element of felinity.

## Why Clawr?

Clawr's goal is not just to help you tell computers what to do — it's to help you express your ideas clearly, so others (and your future self) can understand them. Code should read like your intent, not like a puzzle for the compiler.

## Core Principles

Clarity is the fundamental goal of the Clawr language. Everything else follows from this:

- **Clarity first**: Code that reads like your intent
- **Model your domain**: Focus on what you’re building, not technical plumbing
- **Refactor fearlessly**: Easy refactoring, even without automated tools
- **Embrace isolation**: Predictable behavior through value semantics
- **Flexible encapsulation**: Object-oriented when you need it, data-oriented when you don’t

A roaring lion may not be as obvious as a screeching monkey, but I think it’s more dignified.

## Get Started

Let’s start with something simple — [your first Clawr program](./tutorial/hello-world.md).
