# Contributing to Clawr

Thanks for your interest! Clawr is intended to be a community project. It is not a one-man show. I would prefer to eventually transfer stewardship to the community as it matures.

I only ask that you honour the original philosophy and goals including making the compiler intelligent enough that the programmer can focus on modelling rather than memory technicalities.

A few ground rules:

- PRs are welcome. If you submit a PR, please include automated tests and a short description.
- I do not guarantee to respond to issues or PRs within any timeframe.
- Stewardship can be transferred if multiple people commit to maintaining and honouring the project.
- Please follow the code style and include unit tests for new features.

If you want to become a maintainer, please open a PR adding yourself to MAINTAINERS.
